# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Practical Part** #JavaScript30
**Theoretical** Eloquent JavaScript

### Day 0: February 09, 2019
##### (just starting)

**Today's Progress**: Made first task from #JavaScript30 the begnning to almost the end [ https://tdudkowski.github.io/JavaScript30/1.JS-DrumKit/ ]. alco read Introduction, and the first chapter od Eloquent JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** It still surprises me, how many things I can when forgotting assumption *I dont know*. In most cases enough is to make some steps, rethink, find the problem, make some steps, find errors in definition of problem, rethink, make some steps, etc.

**German** Modalverben, unregelmäßigen und starken Verben

### Day 1: February 10, 2019
##### (obstacles' growing)

**Today's Progress**: as yesterday all section of #Javascript30, this time JS Clock [ https://tdudkowski.github.io/JavaScript30/2.CSS+JS-Clock/ ]. 2nd chapter of Eloquent JS read, and exercises done. Also some corrections (RWD) to yesterday's Drum Kit. My local github repo crashed, spend some time in the Labirynth of bad news like "No source control providers registered." and " The current branch master has no upstream branch" looks like hell of ovelapping errors, probably the best would be set this repo anew.

**Thoughts:**  Love to code, but it's so time consuming alas! so I'm not sure if this tempo can be maintained long.

**German** Modalverben, unregelmäßigen und starken Verben, fortgesetzt; Noten organisieren. Heute abend Lektion mit Tomasz Zalewski.

### Day 2: February 11, 2019
##### (obstacles' growing even more)

**Today's Progress**: as yesterday all section of #Javascript30, this time 3. Playing with CSS Variables and JS [ https://tdudkowski.github.io/JavaScript30/3.Playing-with-CSS-Variables-and-JS/ ], from the reason unknow it doesn't work on smartphones, big FAIL. 3nd chapter of Eloquent JS read, and exercises done.

**Thoughts:** already tired, the only fun is in learning new things, and it - really, really - counts.

**German** Noten organisieren.

### Day 3: February 12, 2019
##### (do not complain)

**Today's Progress**: as yesterday all section of #Javascript30, this time Array Cardio Day 1, but instead of exercises I've made list of methods of an array. 4nd chapter of Eloquent JS read, and one exercise done. I should repeat it tommorow. No reason to run faster than comprehension of a material.

**Thoughts:** now I've started to understand what is a work at the basis. Probably.

**German** Noten organisieren. Yep.

### Day 4: February 13, 2019
##### (math is hard)

**Today's Progress**: finally stucked at Eloquent JS, one chapter more and later back to understand all and make all exercises. JS30: this day Flex Panel Img Gallery;

**Thoughts:** 5% passed

**German** Verben

### Day 5: February 14, 2019
##### (concentrate n practice)

**Today's Progress**: 6&7 part of Wes Bos course done, 6th chapter of Eloquent JS read, todays, I've made 1st function w/ promise...

**Thoughts:** ... and I promise to make more practice than theory; theory is great but it has to walk on earth

**German** Verben.

### Day 6: February 15, 2019
##### (easy day is a lost day)

**Today's Progress**: 3 exercises from JavaScript30, and some reading.

**Thoughts:** even tedious work can be satisfying not only by its end, video player I resign to do this day occured quite nice.

**German** Verben

### Day 7: February 16, 2019
##### (too much is too much)

**Today's Progress**: 4th chapter Eloquent JS read again, and I'm really surprised how much i lost at first reading; 5 exercises form JavaScript30 done, so now it it 15/30, I'm just in the middle

**Thoughts:** balance!

**German** lost in that, all time around taken by JS

### Day 8: February 17, 2019
##### (fine sunday break)

**Today's Progress**: Change! Started my own project instead of routine. That'll be BIG, now it's is only a start input/output data of a Memory Game.

**Thoughts:** balance achieved

**German** lost in that, all time around taken by JS

### Day 9: February 18, 2019
##### (too much again)

**Today's Progress**: Next 5 exercises from Wes Bos course done, I'm not happy on the result, but whatever 20/30 means I'm near the end

**Thoughts:** result is result

**German** never ever use the world 'tommorow' ooops, lost this game again

### Day 10: February 19, 2019
##### (I'm not a diaryst)

**Today's Progress**: added counter to Github Page, 5 next exercises done, only 5 left to do

**Thoughts:** now I see there's one day lost, too messed

**German** null

### Day 11: February 20, 2019
##### (looking for a ay lost)

**Today's Progress**: OK, i found this day, on twitter I've added two days as a 9th day, so now I should add one, eeer whatever; new date counter script, new design project page, almost finished js30

**Thoughts:** more optimism, less results

**German** null, all hands on js

### Day 12: Feruary 21, 2019

**German** null, as yesterday

### Day 13: February 22, 2019
##### (completism)

**Today's Progress**: all what I've done placed in files, files put in Gihub, never thought it is so time consuming

**Thoughts:** many little tasks == much time

**German** null, as yesterday

### Day 14, February 23, 2019
##### (completism, but it had to be done)

**Today's Progress**: all projects revised, counted, summary written, to-do described
